CHALLENGE:
a. Create a button that has 4 possible actions when clicked - after
they are performed, return the button to its base conditions.
Each result should be randomly selected with each click.
We are looking to see the results. We are not
concerned with how they are created. For instance
you could create six different buttons, with a
different background color and swap then them out.
However, I am not encouraging this.
i. Enlarge the button - text size remains the same
ii. Change color - Transition between 6 colors (Transition with
an effect if you are able to, however this is not
required).
iii.Morph the button into a circle, square, triangle.
iv. Change page background to red, blue, and then green.
v. Move the button to another location on the page.
